*GIS* in *NODE.JS*

hi

my name is *calvin*

~if~ when I go to fast don't hesitate to ask a question

think of this as a *clothesline* talk

what is *node*?

in *python* terms

not *django*

not *flask*

*node* is equivalent to *python*

language

run time/vm

standard library

(bring your own batteries)

((except package manager))

yes but why?

'concurent'

i'm not going to wait, call me back

good for *iobound* stuff

like servers

or http requests

or reading files

backends

*postgres*

some great adapters (*knex*, *pg.js*)

the best *sql* database

also for querying

the best *json* database

*levelup*

key value store

with ordered keys

plugable backend

including:

memory

browsers datastores

indexedDB/websql/localstorage

riak

postgres/mysql/sqlite

huge ecosystem for backends and plugins

*pouchdb*

json database that syncs

master <-> master replication

multiple backends

leveldb on node

websql/indexedDB in browser

*couchdb* (or *cloudant*) on the server

or run it on the server


*what*

*geojson*

The last worst geospatial format

except for all the others

more from raj ~~later~~ earlier

*topojson*

lossy compaction for geojson

perfect for web maps

horrible python port

spec!

*streams*

long pipelines of operations

where only a small part is in memory

especially good with geojson

can be put into postgis, gme, esri

soon to be standardized into the web

used for

geocoding with massgis several hundred thousand addresses

upload all tiles from mbtiles to d3/google cloud storage

*turf*

![](https://www.mapbox.com/img/team/morgan.jpg) by morgan herlocker

less horrible version of JavaScript Topology Suite

things like

buffer

centroid

convex

is-clockwise

jenks

*tile mill*

make web maps

that aren't ugly

nothing compares

also vector tiles

*d3*

*innovative* with *projections*

not a typo

*koop*

esri server

in node

open source

on github

*tile live*

tile server

easy

couple apps built with this

kublai and tessera

*game utilities*

spatial isn't special

path finding === routing

hit detection is just comparing 2 bboxen

*related*

sometimes you don't need 'real gis'

like if it's only points

*seriously* just use a geohash

because you can do that with leveldb

but that was a different talk
